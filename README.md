## General Styles

```css
body {
    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    line-height: 1.6;
    color: #000000;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Font Family**: We’ve chosen `Roboto` to give the entire page a clean and modern appearance.
- **Margins and Padding**: Set to `0` to remove default browser styling.
- **Line Height**: Set to `1.6` for better readability.

---

## Container

```css
.container {
    width: 80%;
    margin: auto;
    overflow: hidden;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Container Width**: Restricted to 80% of the page width and centered with `margin: auto`.
- **Flexbox Layout**: Used to align the logo and navigation on the same line. The `justify-content: space-between` ensures that elements like the logo and nav items are spaced out properly.

## Header

```css
.header {
    background: #7aa1c4;
    color: #883737;
    padding: 10px 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Header Background**: The header has a background color of light blue (`#7aa1c4`) and text color of dark red (`#883737`).
- **Padding**: Gives vertical padding to make the header visually appealing.

---

## Hero Section

```css
.hero {
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    color: black;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Height**: Set to `100vh` to take the full height of the viewport.
- **Flexbox**: Aligns the content (text and image) vertically in the center of the section.
- **Hero Image and Content**: The `.hero-container` uses `justify-content: space-between` to place the hero image on one side and the text content on the other.

---

## About Us Section

```css
.about {
    padding: 60px 20px;
    background: #f4f4f4;
    text-align: center;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Padding**: 60px for vertical padding and 20px for horizontal padding to ensure good spacing.
- **Text Alignment**: The text is centered using `text-align: center`, making the content visually balanced.
- **Title**: The `h2` for the About section has its own styling for spacing and size, ensuring it stands out.

---

## Products Section

```css
.products {
    padding: 60px 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Padding**: Vertical padding of 60px gives space around the section.
- **Product Grid**: A `flexbox` layout (`.product-grid`) is used to arrange the product cards in a row. If the screen size is too small, they will wrap into multiple rows using `flex-wrap: wrap`.

---

## Testimonials Section

```css
.testimonials {
    padding: 60px 0;
    background: #e4e4e4;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Background Color**: Light grey background to differentiate the testimonials from other sections.
- **Padding**: Adds spacing for visual clarity and room around the content.

---

## Contact Us Section

```css
.contact {
    padding: 60px 20px;
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #ffffff, #f9f9f9);
    text-align: center;
    border-radius: 10px;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Background Gradient**: A subtle gradient adds depth to the section.
- **Border Radius** and **Box Shadow**: Applied to give the section a card-like appearance.
- **Center Alignment**: The contact form is centered within the section.

---

## Form Styling

```css
.contact form {
    max-width: 600px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    background: #cfe3f7;
    border-radius: 10px;
    padding: 70px;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Form Layout**: The form uses `flex-direction: column` to stack input fields vertically.
- **Background Color**: Light blue (`#cfe3f7`) background to contrast with the page’s sections.
- **Max Width**: The form is limited to 600px for readability.
- **Padding** and **Border Radius**: Padding adds space around inputs, and border-radius gives rounded corners.

## Button Hover Effects

```css
.btn-submit:hover {
    background-color: #0056b3;
    transform: scale(1.05);
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Hover Effect**: The button slightly changes color and scales up when hovered, giving a dynamic effect to the user interaction.

---

## Responsive Design

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .hero-content h1 {
        font-size: 2em;
    }
    
    .contact form {
        padding: 20px;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Media Query**: This section ensures that the design adapts to screens narrower than 768px. The font size and padding are adjusted for smaller devices.
- **Flexbox Layout**: The page uses `flexbox` throughout to ensure a responsive and flexible layout. Sections like the product grid automatically adjust based on screen size, wrapping rows of content as needed.

---

## Conclusion

This CSS file leverages modern techniques like **Flexbox**, **media queries**, and **responsive units** to ensure that the layout looks great on all screen sizes. We’ve paid special attention to clean typography, spacing, and user-friendly hover effects, making the page visually appealing and functional.
